<h2>Question 1: Which music genres have the highest total play counts among the top 50 tracks globally? </h2>
<p>Once the genre data was integrated into the dataset, we compiled the information into a Pandas DataFrame. The next step involved aggregating the play counts by genre to understand the relative popularity of different music styles. We used the groupby function to sum the play counts for each genre, followed by sorting the genres in descending order to identify which ones had the highest total play counts among the top 50 tracks. 

The resulting dataset revealed that Pop was by far the most-played genre, with a total of 310,976,942 play counts, significantly surpassing other genres. Hip-Hop followed as the second most-played genre, with 140,375,820 plays, while R&B ranked third with 108,800,524 plays. Other prominent genres included Indie Rock and Indie Pop, with play counts of 38,637,392 and 32,627,596, respectively. Interestingly, genres like 80s and Folk, while less popular, still contributed notable play counts of 11,133,298 and 9,353,785, respectively, indicating a continued appreciation for older and niche music styles. The genre seen live, which might refer to live performances or specific concerts, appeared in the dataset with a total play count of 41,925,406, suggesting the popularity of live music experiences. 

In summary, the analysis of the top 50 tracks globally revealed that Pop dominated global music consumption, followed by strong showings from Hip-Hop and R&B, while indie and niche genres also held significant but smaller portions of the global listening landscape. This exploration of genre play counts provides valuable insight into current musical trends and listener preferences across the world. </p>
